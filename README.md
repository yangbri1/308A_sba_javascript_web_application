## How to get started
### Functionality over form!!
### Found some interesting API's while checking them out but many of of them documentations were inadequate or requires constantly being logged in (private API). Spent too much time starting an idea but half-way through realizing the API is a no-go sadly. At the end, decided that simple is best and went with a popular API with extensive documentation to back things up.
